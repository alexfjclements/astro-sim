## gravforce Readme
##
## gravforce uses two data input files. One specifies the initial position and velocity of one particle, 
## the other does the same for the second. Without this file the program will not run.
##
## Each data file contains a set of numerical values. These are arranged to give first the mass, 
## position, then the velocity. The latter two are in cartesian coordinates.
##
## Number of loops is set to 1000, and timestep to 0.01. Both are clearly labelled in the code and thus 
## are easy to change.
